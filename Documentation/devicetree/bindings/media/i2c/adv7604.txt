* Analog Devices ADV7604/11 video decoder with HDMI receiver

The ADV7604 and ADV7611 are multiformat video decoders with an integrated HDMI
receiver. The ADV7604 has four multiplexed HDMI inputs and one analog input,
and the ADV7611 has one HDMI input and no analog input.

These device tree bindings support the ADV7611 only at the moment.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must contain one of the following
    - "adi,adv7611" for the ADV7611

  - reg: I2C slave addresses
    The ADV7604 has thirteen 256-byte maps that can be accessed via the main
    I²C ports. Each map has it own I²C address and acts
    as a standard slave device on the I²C bus.

  - hpd-gpios: References to the GPIOs that control the HDMI hot-plug
    detection pins, one per HDMI input. The active flag indicates the GPIO
    level that enables hot-plug detection.

The device node must contain one 'port' child node per device input and output
port, in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt. The port nodes
are numbered as follows.

  Port			ADV7611
------------------------------------------------------------
  HDMI			0
  Digital output	1

The digital output port node must contain at least one endpoint.

Optional Properties:

  - reset-gpios: Reference to the GPIO connected to the device's reset pin.
  - reg-names : Names of maps with programmable addresses.
		It can contain any map needing another address than default one.
		Possible maps names are :
ADV7604 : "main", "avlink", "cec", "infoframe", "esdp", "dpp", "afe", "rep",
		"edid", "hdmi", "test", "cp", "vdp"
ADV7611 : "main", "cec", "infoframe", "afe", "rep", "edid", "hdmi", "cp"

Optional Endpoint Properties:

  The following three properties are defined in video-interfaces.txt and are
  valid for source endpoints only.

  - hsync-active: Horizontal synchronization polarity. Defaults to active low.
  - vsync-active: Vertical synchronization polarity. Defaults to active low.
  - pclk-sample: Pixel clock polarity. Defaults to output on the falling edge.

  If none of hsync-active, vsync-active and pclk-sample is specified the
  endpoint will use embedded BT.656 synchronization.


Example:

	hdmi_receiver@4c {
		compatible = "adi,adv7611";
		/* edid page will be accessible @ 0x66 on i2c bus */
		/* other maps keep their default addresses */
		reg = <0x4c 0x66>;
		reg-names = "main", "edid";

		reset-gpios = <&ioexp 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		hpd-gpios = <&ioexp 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};
		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			hdmi_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&ccdc_in>;
			};
		};
	};
